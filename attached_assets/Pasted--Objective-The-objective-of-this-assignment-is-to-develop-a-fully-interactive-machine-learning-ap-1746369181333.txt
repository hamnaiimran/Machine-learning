🎯 Objective
The objective of this assignment is to develop a fully interactive machine learning application using financial datasets. Students will integrate Kragle datasets, fetch data from Yahoo Finance, implement machine learning models, and visualize the step-by-step ML workflow through a well-designed Streamlit interface.

Fetch real-time stock market data using Yahoo Finance API (yfinance library).
Machine Learning Models (Choose one):

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
K-Means Clustering
Python Libraries:

streamlit
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
plotly
yfinance
Design Elements:

Apply a consistent color scheme and theme.
Add GIFs, animations, and pictures to enhance the user experience.
Include button-based navigation, notifications, and step-by-step visualizations.
🛠️ Task Description
You are required to build an interactive Streamlit application following these major steps:

1. Welcome Interface
   Display a welcome message with a finance-themed GIF.
   Apply a custom background color and themed buttons.
   Sidebar should allow:
   Uploading a Kragle dataset.
   Fetching Yahoo Finance stock data.
2. Step-by-Step Machine Learning Pipeline
   Each step must be activated using a separate button and confirmed with a notification (st.success, st.info, etc.).

Step	Description	Visual/Notification
Load Data	Upload or fetch financial data.	Data preview table, load success message
Preprocessing	Clean missing values, outliers, etc.	Display missing value stats, preprocessing notification
Feature Engineering	Select and transform features.	Show feature importance/selection results
Train/Test Split	Split data into training/testing sets.	Visualize split with pie chart
Model Training	Train chosen ML model.	Notification of training completion
Evaluation	Evaluate the model.	Display metrics and evaluation charts
Results Visualization	Predict outcomes or show clusters.	Graphs, cluster visualizations
3\. Additional Features
Use Plotly for interactive charts wherever possible.
Display appropriate notifications after each stage.
Add themed GIFs/pictures on key pages (start, end, etc.).
(Bonus) Allow users to download the results.
📊 Expected Deliverables
A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with complete, properly commented code.
A Streamlit application that runs locally.
(Optional Bonus) A deployed Streamlit Cloud link for public access.
🎁 Bonus Points
Allow dynamic model selection.
Add feature importance visualization (if using Linear or Logistic Regression).
Schedule real-time Yahoo Finance data updates.
Downloadable model or results.
⚡ Important Instructions
Use consistent colors and visual themes throughout the app.
Interactive navigation is mandatory (buttons for every major step).
Proper error handling must be included (e.g., if no dataset is loaded).
Submit a neat, well-commented and easy-to-navigate notebook.
Include a brief "How to Run" note at the top of your notebook.
